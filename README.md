# Infinite Scroll (Using Intersection Observer)
This React application incorporates the Infinite Scroll feature using an Intersection Observer. It enables a seamless loading of additional content as the user scrolls down the page, providing a dynamic and continuous browsing experience.

## Implementation
The Infinite Scroll functionality is achieved by detecting the scroll position and triggering the loading of more content when the user approaches the end of the current content.
